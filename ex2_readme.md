## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

#### Addition (`+=`)
- Syntax: `graph1 += graph2`
- Description: Adds the adjacency matrices of `graph1` and `graph2` element-wise, updating `graph1` with the result.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    Graph graph2(3);
    // Load graphs with data...
    graph1 += graph2; // Add graph2 to graph1
    ```

#### Subtraction (`-=``)
- Syntax: `graph1 -= graph2`
- Description: Subtracts the adjacency matrix of `graph2` from `graph1` element-wise, updating `graph1` with the result.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    Graph graph2(3);
    // Load graphs with data...
    graph1 -= graph2; // Subtract graph2 from graph1
    ```

#### Multiplication (`*`, `*=``)
- Syntax: `graph1 * scalar`, `graph1 *= scalar`
- Description: Multiplies the adjacency matrix of `graph1` by a scalar value, updating `graph1` with the result.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    int scalar = 2;
    graph1 *= scalar; // Multiply graph1 by 2
    ```

### Comparison Operators

#### Less Than (`<`)
- Syntax: `graph1 < graph2`
- Description: Checks if `graph1` is strictly smaller than `graph2` based on their adjacency matrices and sizes.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    Graph graph2(3);
    // Load graphs with data...
    if (graph1 < graph2) {
        // Do something...
    }
    ```

#### Equal To (`==`)
- Syntax: `graph1 == graph2`
- Description: Checks if `graph1` is equal to `graph2` based on their adjacency matrices and sizes.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    Graph graph2(3);
    // Load graphs with data...
    if (graph1 == graph2) {
        // Do something...
    }
    ```

### Unary Operators

#### Unary Plus (`+`)
- Syntax: `+graph`
- Description: Returns a new graph where each element of the adjacency matrix is positive.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    Graph positiveGraph = +graph1; // Get a graph with positive elements
    ```

#### Unary Minus (`-`)
- Syntax: `-graph`
- Description: Returns a new graph where each element of the adjacency matrix is negated.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    Graph negatedGraph = -graph1; // Get a graph with negated elements
    ```

### Output Operator

#### Output (`<<`)
- Syntax: `cout << graph`
- Description: Prints the string representation of the graph's adjacency matrix to the standard output.
- Example:
    ```cpp
    Graph graph1(3);
    //load Graph with data
    cout << graph1; // Print the graph to the console
    ```

## `loadGraph` Method

The `loadGraph` method allows you to initialize the graph with data. It can be used in two ways:

1. Loading from a Vector of Vectors:
   - Syntax: `loadGraph(vector<vector<int>> g)`
   - Description: Initializes the graph with data from a 2D vector representing the adjacency matrix.
   - Example:
        ```cpp
        Graph graph(3);
        vector<vector<int>> graph = {{0, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0}};
        graph.loadGraph(data);
        ```

2. Loading from Another Graph Object:
   - Syntax: `loadGraph(Graph g)`
   - Description: Initializes the graph with adjacency matrix from another Graph.
   - Example:
        ```cpp
        Graph graph1(3);
        Graph graph2(3);
        // Load graph data...
        graph1.loadGraph(graph2);
        ```
